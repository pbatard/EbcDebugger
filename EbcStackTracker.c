  Update the stack tracker according to the latest natural and constant
  value stack manipulation operations.

  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  Not enough memory to grow the stack tracker.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The stack tracker is being underflown due to
                                unbalanced stack operations.
  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The stack tracker was updated successfully.
